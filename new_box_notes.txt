-- restart: NOTE: firefox did NOT preserve state, maybe due to upgrade

8. 1password setup to move to 1password for ssh key management
   https://support.1password.com/install-linux/
   tabled: main window insta-crashes on open

9. Manual key transfer of `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, `private.pgp` for imbue

`chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

 git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/1password.git

10.  pacman -S ack

get cursor appimage from https://www.trycursor.com/

app image issue: fuse
 
sudo chmod u+s "$(which fusermount3)
dlopen(): error loading libfuse.so.2
sudo pacman -S fuse

started putting dependencies in arch_setup.sh

git complains: Please tell me who you are

enabled slack notifications

NOTE: tmux yank not working out of the box
NOTE: tmux background is light grey in konsole

NOTE: ENV vars for dotfiles repo not really streamlined

NOTE: overrode  VSCODE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/Cursor/User for now
this seemed to work for settings setup


cloning git@gitlab.com:generally-intelligent/generally_intelligent.git worked


had to chsh -s /usr/bin/bash
then `pkill -KILL -u mjr` to get bash


cachy browser not retaining sessions.
Fix:
```
defaultPref("privacy.clearOnShutdown.history", false);
defaultPref("privacy.clearOnShutdown.downloads", false);
```

Need to route firefox config to cachy-browser (if I want to keep using it):
/home/mjr/.cachy/n9j1ed1p.default-release/

firefox dir about:profiles
/home/mjr/.mozilla/firefox/b6q5k1a8.default-release/

need to make the linux script blackbox agnostic

set default search to ddg

toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets has to be set to true

moved app images into /usr/local/bin
then /opt
FUCKING WHERE DO YOU PUT APPLICATIONS TO GET THEM PICKED UP BY KRUNNER WTF


installed AM
https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM#installation

am -i obsidian cursor
good enough, installs in /opt/obisidian

1password just crashes all the time


---
A new day:
- weird font issue in cursor terminal
- got nvim plugins installed
- set konsole profile to solarized, which helps with color issue.

need to:
- get tmux yank working
- ensure github is set up to push
- pull text and ensure obsidian is working

would like to to:
- firefox userchrome is kinda fucked up
- 1password: uninstalled aur, which let me use browser login

---
got tmux-yank working by:
- manually installing: ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/scripts/install_plugins.sh
- pacman -S xclip xsel

- pacman -S wl_clipboard
